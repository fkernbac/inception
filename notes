localhost IP:
You may have noticed that this command binds the port mapping to a different IP address. Previous docker run commands published ports to 127.0.0.1:3000 on the host. This time, you’re using 0.0.0.0.

Binding to 127.0.0.1 only exposes a container’s ports to the loopback interface. Binding to 0.0.0.0, however, exposes the container’s port on all interfaces of the host, making it available to the outside world.
